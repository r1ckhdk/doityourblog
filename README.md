# doityourblog
Just my own backyard on the lazyweb.

You can find my blog at [doityourblog.com](https://doityourblog.com).

Currently I'm self hosting it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [nginx](https://nginx.org/) and [CloudFlare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/).

As for now, I'm using the [Roadster](https://github.com/mansoorbarri/roadster) theme, which is a fork of the [Mainroad](https://github.com/Vimux/Mainroad) theme.

## To-do

- Implement CI to build site with every new push to main branch.
- Add more blog posts.
- Figure the fuck out of customizing themes and tuning Hugo settings.
